Worflow scores is a Jupyter notebook in which a PPIN (protein-protein interacton network) is created using STRING, and which reimplements the network-based method Menche et al. (2015) for identifying relationships between diseases and traits on the interactome using SNP associations from GWAS. It uses the EFO database to classify them into disease and traits. 
SNP-based phenotype network and Null Model is a Jupyter notebook that uses GWAS SNP-trait associations to create SNP-based networks and analyzes their network coherence properties, as previously done by Jablonski et al. (2022). It also includes the null model used for randomization.
